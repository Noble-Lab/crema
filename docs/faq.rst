What is a pairing file?
-------
A pairing file is a tab-delimited file that explicity pairs target and decoy
peptide sequences. Previous work has shown that taking advantage of paired
target and decoys can lead to improved number of peptide detections (see 
`Lin et al. <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00282>`_).
This file can be generated by setting --peptide-list=T in tide-index within the
`Crux toolkit <https://crux.ms>`_ or by hand.

If this file is generated by hand the following three columns are required. One
column must be labeled 'target' must contain target sequences, a second 
column labeled 'decoy(s)' must contain decoy sequences, and a third column
labeled 'proteins' must contain a comma separated list of proteins the target
peptide could originate from.
